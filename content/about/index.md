I'm QuBit, a hobbyist programmer from India. I'm passionate about data and data driven technologies. Currently working at a small startup where I'm responsible for designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines and systems that facilitate the collection, storage and analysis of large volume of timeseries.

Thank you for visiting.
